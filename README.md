## 🧬 Pokémon Dataset Analysis – Predicting Rarity & Legendary Status

This project explores the use of **machine learning classification** models to analyze Pokémon attributes and predict their rarity and legendary status. It showcases my skills in data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation — all based on a real-world dataset from Kaggle.

### 📘 Project Overview

This notebook covers two main predictive tasks:

1. **Binary Classification**  
   - **Goal:** Predict if a Pokémon is **Legendary** (`True/False`)
   - **Model:** Logistic Regression

2. **Multi-Class Classification**  
   - **Goal:** Classify a Pokémon as **Common**, **Uncommon**, **Rare**, or **Legendary**
   - **Model:** K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

### 📂 Dataset Description

- Source: [Kaggle – Pokémon with Stats](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abcsds/pokemon)
- Features:
  - Combat stats (HP, Attack, Defense, etc.)
  - Typing (Type 1 & 2)
  - Generation
  - Legendary status (target for binary classification)

### 🧪 Project Flow

1. Data Cleaning & Inspection  
2. Encoding categorical features (e.g., Pokémon types)  
3. Feature selection and transformation  
4. Model training and evaluation for both tasks  
5. Hyperparameter tuning for KNN
